# SQLite CRUD API

This project is a lightweight REST API for manipulating SQLite databases.  

---

## Why This Exists

I made this API for several reasons:  

1. **Proof of Concept for SQLite manipulation**  
   I wanted to experiment with direct SQLite database manipulation. This API was my testbed, using a language I’m most comfortable with. Instead of building a UI right away, I used Postman to interact with the API and manage data.

2. **Future Work / Electron App**  
   My eventual goal is to build a local Electron app for managing SQLite files. These API functions will map cleanly to the backend of that app and provide a clear structure for what the frontend needs.

3. **Potential Web Use**  
   While a web app wasn’t the original intent, this API could also serve as the backend for one. Anyone else is welcome to use it for a simple, file-based SQLite manipulation API.

4. **Frontend Layout**  
   By designing this API, I’ve effectively created the blueprint for the Electron frontend. The API clarifies what functions are needed at each level of the stack.

## API Overview

The API provides **CRUD operations** at 4 distinct layers:

- **Databases**: Create, list, rename, or delete SQLite files.
- **Tables**: Create, search, paginate, sort, edit, and delete tables within a database.
- **Columns**: Define and manage the structure of a table, using metadata for types, tags, and constraints.
- **Rows**: Insert, edit, patch, or delete actual data inside tables.

Additionally, there is a rigid structure to the databases created by this API. Six columns which cannot be deleted, renamed, or moved are: id, title, content, data modified, date created, hidden. The only two that are necessary to use are id and title, as id is autogenerated and title cannot be left blank. You could theoretically hide each of these columns and never use them.

## Endpoints

### Database Level

#### Create a Database
```http
POST {{baseURL}}/api/database
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "test"
}
